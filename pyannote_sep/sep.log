Lightning automatically upgraded your loaded checkpoint from v1.8.6 to v2.4.0. To apply the upgrade to your files permanently, run `python -m pytorch_lightning.utilities.upgrade_checkpoint ../../../../.cache/torch/pyannote/models--pyannote--separation-ami-1.0/snapshots/4d38e95cfd067c894b8b60b00761831fb01e4a8c/pytorch_model.bin`
Some weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/wavlm-large were not used when initializing WavLMModel: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v']
- This IS expected if you are initializing WavLMModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing WavLMModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of WavLMModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/wavlm-large and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0', 'encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
